Platform: Web application
Language: Javascript
Library: React

## Steps to build the app using React


## Steps to run the app locally

1. Fork this repo and clone it
2. Navigate to this directory and run the following codes:
    ``` bash
    npm install
    code -r .
    ```
3. Once all the dependencies in the previous step have been installed, run the app locally with the following code:
    ``` bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Assumptions and things that were not clear

## Improvements for future development
- Create a filter function with the cuisines by either making a drop down menu to pick the cuisines of your choice or listing all the cuisines and making them clickable to filter your favourites.
- Use a map to display the address of the restaurant since the coordinates are present in the API. This can be done by using a react map package or using Google Map's developer features.
- Create a sorting function where you can sort the restaurants by their name or rating for example.
